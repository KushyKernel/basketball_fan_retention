    for _ in range(1000):  # Monte Carlo iterations
        random_churn_month = np.random.choice(
            range(len(survival_probs)), 
            p=survival_probs / survival_probs.sum()
        )
        clv = sum([

    for customer_id in customers:
        for offer_id in offers:
            assign_vars[(customer_id, offer_id)] = pulp.LpVariable(
                f"assign_{customer_id}_{offer_id}", cat='Binary'
            )
    
    # Objective function: maximize expected CLV uplift
    prob = pulp.LpProblem("Campaign_Optimization", pulp.LpMaximize)
    prob += pulp.lpSum([
        assign_vars[(c, o)] * expected_clv_uplift[c][o] - offer_costs[o]
        for c in customers for o in offers
    ])
    
    # Constraints

        assign_vars[(c, o)] * offer_costs[o]
        for c in customers for o in offers
    ]) <= budget
    
    # Each customer gets at most one offer
    for customer in customers:
        prob += pulp.lpSum([
            assign_vars[(customer, o)] for o in offers
        ]) <= 1

```python
import pulp

# Optimize marketing budget allocation
prob = pulp.LpProblem("Marketing_Optimization", pulp.LpMaximize)

# Decision variables: assign customers to offers
customer_offer_vars = {}
for customer in customers:
    for offer in offers:
        customer_offer_vars[(customer, offer)] = pulp.LpVariable(
            f"assign_{customer}_{offer}", cat='Binary'
        )

# Objective: maximize expected revenue
prob += pulp.lpSum([
    customer_offer_vars[(c, o)] * expected_revenue[c][o]
